Thanks for sharing your code! This is a robust user authentication controller for an Express backend. You're covering key features like registration, login, email verification, password reset, refresh tokens, and profile updates. Great job!

Here’s a **detailed review** with **improvements**, **bugs**, and **best practices**:

---

### ✅ **Strengths**

* Uses **token-based email verification** and **refresh tokens**.
* Secure **password handling** with `bcrypt`.
* Implements **httpOnly cookies** for refresh tokens — great for security.
* Covers all major user flows: register, login, refresh, logout, password reset, update, delete.

### ❗ **Critical Issues**

#### 1. **Duplicate `updateProfile` export**

```js
exports.updateProfile = async (...) => {...}
exports.updateProfile = async (...) => {...}
```

✅ **Fix**: Remove one of the duplicate `updateProfile` functions. Otherwise, the last one will override the first silently.

---

#### 2. **Missing `verifyRefreshToken` import**

```js
const { id } = verifyRefreshToken(token);
```

✅ **Fix**: Make sure `verifyRefreshToken` is imported:

```js
const { verifyRefreshToken } = require("../utils/jwt.js");
```

---

#### 3. **Missing bcrypt import in `resetPassword`**

You're using:

```js
const hashedPassword = await bcryptjs.hash(password, 10);
```

But `bcryptjs` is not imported.
✅ **Fix**:

```js
const bcryptjs = require("bcrypt"); // or use "bcryptjs" package if you're using that
```

Or if you're already using `bcrypt` consistently, just use:

```js
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
```

---

#### 4. **`comparePassword` is used but not defined in model**

In `updatePassword`, you use:

```js
const isMatch = await user.comparePassword(currentPassword);
```

✅ **Make sure** your `User` model has a `comparePassword` method:

```js
UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function (enteredPassword) {
  return bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword, this.password);
};
```

---

#### 5. **Hardcoded URL in verification link**

```js
const verifyLink = `${process.env.CLIENT_URL}/api/auth/verify-email?token=${verificationToken}`;
```

This may work fine, but it's not used since you're using:

```js
await sendVerificationEmail(user);
```

✅ **Suggestion**: Ensure `sendVerificationEmail` internally uses the correct link (include token in the URL passed).

---

### ⚠️ **Suggestions & Improvements**

#### 6. **Use try-catch in `register`**

If any DB operation or email fails, no error will be caught.

✅ Wrap `register` logic in a `try-catch` block:

```js
exports.register = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email, password } = req.body;
    ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Registration failed" });
  }
};
```

---

#### 7. **Sanitize or validate email and password**

Use a validator library like `zod`, `express-validator`, or `validator` for better input validation.

---

#### 8. **Consider expiring unverified accounts**

You may want to delete accounts that were created but never verified within X minutes/hours — can be scheduled using `Agenda`, which you’re already using.

### ✅ After Fixing, Your Controller Will Be Solid!

Let me know if you’d like:

* **Unit tests** for these endpoints
* **Refactor into MVC folder structure**
* **Zod/Yup validation examples**
* **Rate limiter or brute-force protection**

Would you like me to clean and rewrite the full code after fixing all the above issues?
